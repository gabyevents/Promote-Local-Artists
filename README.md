# Promote-Local-Artists
Hello everyone!  We are a small foundation that has always supported local musicians and groups with activities, events at the national level. Due to the pandemic, our talented youth and local groups have lost all support, they are disappearing.   We ask for your donations in order to encourage our youth local talent to promote their music with videos, photo sessions, merchandise, virtual events and digital platforms.   Your donations are very important and will make a world of difference for our musicians, local artists to continue their passion creation with music as well as one day encourage and teach others.   We hope to have everyone's support to achieve our social cultural projects. We thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read as well as donate to our cause.
